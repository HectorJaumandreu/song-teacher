Application to teach songs as a game

Introduction
Song Teacher is a mobile app that helps you learning songs, without having to know any music. The only thing you need is a teach track with your part isolated. Ideally left or right. It can also work with two different files, one with your part solo and other without your part.
Song Teacher will recognise the pitch, tempo and lyrics from your teach track and will help you to learn it, keeping track of your progress, scoring your accuracy and focusing in the parts you are struggling with.
You will be able to see your song as a storyline with notes and duration represented as bars and your lyrics on the top.
First you will listen to your song and then you will be able to sing it getting a first assessment. Then the system will start with small bits of the song, playing them for you and then asking you to reproduce them. You will be able to sing while listening your part, full mix or part missing.
